## 
- A financial option is a right to buy or sell  a financial security.
    
- The right trades separately from the (underlying) security and usually even on a different exchange.
    
- The rights are not (usually) issued by the companies who issue the underlying securities.  
  - Instead, the rights are created when someone buys one from someone else.  
  - Open interest is the number that exist at any time.

##  

- A call option is the right to buy an asset at a pre-specified price.

- A put option is the right to sell an asset at a pre-specified price.

- The pre-specified price is called the exercise price or strike price.  

- An option is valid for a specified period of time, after which it expires.
  - Most financial options can be exercised at any time the owner wishes, prior to expiration.  Such options are called American.
  - There are some options that can only be exercised on the expiration date.  They are called European.  Both types are traded on both continents.

##

- If you've bought an option, you are "long.""  If you've sold an option, you are "short."
- After a trade occurs, the option clearinghouse steps in the middle and becomes the counterparty to both sides.
  - The long party has an option to buy from or sell to the clearinghouse at the strike.
  - The short party has an obligation to sell to or buy from the clearinghouse at the strike.

##

- Usually buyers sell to close their position rather than exercising.
- And sellers buy to close their positions rather than being obliged to buy/sell.
- Open interest rises when a contract first begins to trade, then eventually declines as people trade to close their positions.

## Open Interest Example

- When a contract is first opened for trading, open interest is zero.
- Suppose Andy buys a contract from Chloe, and Brooke buys a contract from David.
  - Longs = Andy and Brooke
  - Shorts = Chloe and David
  - Open interest = 2

## 

- Suppose Andy then sells a contract to David.
  - Andy: long + short = no position
  - David: short + long = no position
  - Longs = Brooke
  - Shorts = Chloe
  - Open interest = 1
    

## Hedging, speculation, and income

- You pay upfront to acquire an option.  
  - The amount you pay is called the option premium.  
  - It is not part of the contract but instead is determined in the market (like a stock price).
- You buy options to hedge or to speculate.  You sell options for income.
- Sellers of options need to have sufficient equity in their accounts (margin).  A buyer needs enough cash to pay the premium but no more (like buying a stock).


      
## Moneyness

- Borrowing language from horse racing, we say a call is
  - in the money if the underlying price is above the strike,
  - at the money if the underlying price equals the strike
  - out of the money if the underlying price is below the strike
- The reverse for puts
 
- Also, "deep in the money" and "deep out of the money"

## Value of a call at maturity

- At maturity (the expiration date), the value of a call is

. . .

$$\begin{cases} 0 & \text{if underlying < strike}\\
 \text{underlying} - \text{strike} & \text{if underlying > strike}
 \end{cases}
 $$

- Equivalently, the value of a call is 

. . .

$$\max(\text{underlying price}-\text{strike}, 0)$$

## Value of a call at maturity

With strike = 50,

. . .


```{python}
import numpy as np
import plotly.express as px

strike = 50
underlying = np.linspace(0, 100, 100)
call = np.maximum(underlying-strike, 0)

fig = px.line(x=underlying, y=call)
fig.update_traces(
    hovertemplate="Underlying = $%{x:.2f}<br>Call = $%{y:.2f}<extra></extra>"
)
fig.update_layout(
    xaxis_title="Underlying Price",
    yaxis_title="Call Option Value",
    xaxis_title_font = {"size":20},
    yaxis_title_font =  {"size":20},
    template="plotly_white"
)
fig.show()
```

## Value of a put at maturity

- At maturity, the value of a put is

. . .

$$\begin{cases} \text{strike} - \text{underlying} & \text{if underlying < strike}\\
 0 & \text{if underlying > strike}
 \end{cases}
 $$

- Equivalently, the value of a put is 

. . .

$$\max(\text{strike}-\text{underlying price}, 0)$$

## Value of a put at maturity

With strike = 50,

. . .


```{python}
import numpy as np
import plotly.express as px

strike = 50
underlying = np.linspace(0, 100, 100)
put = np.maximum(strike-underlying, 0)

fig = px.line(x=underlying, y=put)
fig.update_traces(
    hovertemplate="Underlying = $%{x:.2f}<br>Put = $%{y:.2f}<extra></extra>"
)
fig.update_layout(
    xaxis_title="Underlying Price",
    yaxis_title="Put Option Value",
    xaxis_title_font = {"size":20},
    yaxis_title_font =  {"size":20},
    template="plotly_white"
)
fig.show()
```


## Option Data from Yahoo 

. . .

```.p
import yfinance as yf
cvx = yf.Ticker('CVX')
```

- cvx.options is the set of traded maturities
- cvx.option_chain("some date") is an object containing call and put data
- cvx.option_chain("some date").calls is a dataframe of call info
- cvx.option_chain("some date").puts is a dataframe of put info
