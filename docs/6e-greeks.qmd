##

- Assume that changes in the value of an option are driven by changes in the stock price and the passage of time.
- The value also depends on the strike, interest rate, and volatility, but suppose those things don't change.
- Holding constant the strike, interest rate, and volatility, we can express the values of calls and puts as $C(S, t)$ and $P(S, t)$ where $S$ is the stock price and $t$ is the time to maturity.
