## Intrinsic value

- The "intrinsic value" of an option is what it would be worth if it were immediately expiring.
  - The intrinsic value of a call is max(0, stock price - strike)
  - The intrinsic value of a put is max(0, strike - stock price)
- Prior to maturity, the value of an option usually exceeds its intrinsic value.  It is "better alive than dead."
- No one should exercise when value > intrinsic value

## Early exercise

- Sometimes, prior to maturity, the value of an option equals its the intrinsic value.
- All options should be exercised, or positions should be closed by trading.

## Calls are better alive than dead

- A call option on an underlying asset that does not pay dividends prior to the option maturity should never be exercised early.
- Proof is by put-call parity:

. . .

$$ \text{call price} = \text{stock price} + \text{put price} - \text{PV of strike}$$

. . .

$$ \text{call price} > \text{stock price}  - \text{PV of strike}$$

. . .

$$ \text{call price} > \text{stock price}  - \text{strike}$$


## Early exercise of puts is often optimal

- If the stock price has fallen very low, you can be pretty sure you will not regret exercising a put.
- Exercising the put early gets the cash early, which can be invested.
- There is always a critical stock price (threshold) such that it is optimal to exercise a put when the stock falls below the threshold.
- The threshold depends crucially on the stock volatility.
