        "- A financial option is a right to buy or sell  a financial security.\n",

        "- The right trades separately from the (underlying) security and usually even on a different exchange.\n",
        "    \n",
        "- The rights are not (usually) issued by the companies who issue the underlying securities.  \n",
        "  - Instead, the rights are created when someone buys one from someone else.  \n",
        "  - Open interest is the number that exist at any time.\n",

        "## Example\n",

        "- When a contract is first opened for trading, open interest is zero.\n",
