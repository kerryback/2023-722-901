## Preliminaries

- Get data
- Filter based on, e.g., size if desired
- Define industries and industry dummies if desired
- Transform features and ret in each cross-section
- Define pipeline


## Train and Predict Loop

. . .

For each date in a set of training dates,

- Define training data = past
- Train (possibly using cross-validation to choose hyperparameters)
- Use the trained model to make predictions for each month until the next training date

## portfolio returns

- Use predictions to define portfolios at the beginning of each month. Example: best 100 and worst 100, equally weighted
- Use actual (not transformed) stock returns to compute portfolio returns

## Evaluate returns

- Sharpe ratio, accumulation, drawdowns
- Compared to beta-adjusted market benchmark: alpha, information ratio
- Compare to market and other factors (e.g., Fama-French): alpha, information ratio, attribution analysis
