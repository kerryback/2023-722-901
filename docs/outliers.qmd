## Issues

- Should loop
  - In practice, we would use all past data to train a model before trading on it
  - In a backtest, we should follow the same procedure: at each date us all past data to train and then predict
- Should include industry as a feature
  - E.g., buy value industries or best value in each industry?
  - Parameters may vary by industry
- Feature and target transformations

## Transforming cross-sections

- (time, stock) data is called panel data
- The set of stocks at a point in time is called a cross-section.
- Should transform and standardize each cross-section
  - Relative rankings of features at a point in time should matter rather than ranking across time 
  - To "beat the market," we need to predict which stocks will beat others not what the overall market will do
