## Definition of Industries

- Industry groupings are usually built on SIC codes
- We'll use a couple of examples: Fama-French 12 industries and Fama-French 48 industries
- The mapping SIC code $\mapsto$ industry can be found on French's website
- Here are the 12 industries:

. . .

```{python}
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv("Siccodes12.csv", index_col="industry")
df
```

## Dummy variables

- We can use categorical variables in numerical models by creating dummy variables.
- We create a dummy variable for each industry defined as: =1 if the firm is in the industry and =0 otherwise.
- If we include dummy variables in a linear regression, we allow each industry to have a different intercept.

## Example
