## Single Period Model Again


- Suppose a stock priced at $100 will go up by 10% or down by 10%.
  
. . .

##

- Consider a call  with a strike of $105.  Using the delta argument, we obtained

. . .

##

- If there were no risk premium, the call value would be the expected value discounted at the risk-free rate:

. . .

$$C = \frac{p \times \text{\$}5 + (1-p)\times \text{\$}0}{1.05}$$

- where $p=$ prob of positive return.  The stock price would also be the discounted expected value:

. . .

$$\text{\$}100 = \frac{p \times \text{\$}110 + (1-p) \times \text{\$}90}{1.05}$$

##

- Solve the stock equation for $p$ and substitute into the call option equation.  
- Stock equation is solved as:

. . .

$$p = \frac{r_f - r_d}{r_u - r_d} = \frac{0.05 - (-0.1)}{0.1 - (-0.1)} = \frac{.15}{.2} = 0.75$$

- Calculate the call option value:

. . .

$$C = \frac{0.75 \times \text{\$}5 + 0.25 \times \text{\$}0}{1.05} = \text{\$}3.57$$

##

- $p$ and $1-p$ are called the [risk-neutral probabilities]{style="color: tomato"}.
- Why does this work?
  - Delta hedge argument didn't depend on risk preferences, so we can act as if investors don't require risk premia.
  - Simple algebra!



## Two-period example again


- Suppose a $100 stock goes up by 5% or down by (1/1.05-1) = -4.76% in each of two periods.

. . .

- Suppose the interest rate is 3% per period.

##

- Suppose a call option with a strike of $105 expires at the end of the 2nd period.
- From the delta argument, we obtained

. . .

## Risk-neutral probability

- The risk-neutral probability of "up" is

. . .

$$ p = \frac{r_f - r_d}{r_u - r_d} = \frac{0.03 - (-0.0476)}{0.05 - (-0.0476)} = 0.795$$

##

- Discounting the expected call value (using prob of up = 0.795) at the risk-free rate yields

. . .

## Example code

import numpy as np
S = 100             # stock price
K = 95              # strike
u = 0.05            # up return per period
r = 0.03            # interest rate per period
n = 2               # number of periods
d = 1/(1+u) - 1     # down return per period
p = (r-d) / (u-d)   # risk-neutral prob
x = [S*(1+u)**(n-2*i) for i in range(n+1)]
v = np.maximum(0, np.array(x)-K)
while len(v)>1:
    v = (p*v[:-1]+(1-p)*v[1:]) / (1+r)
v[0]
```
. . .


```{python}
import numpy as np

S = 100    # stock price
K = 95     # strike
u = 0.05   # up return per period
r = 0.03   # interest rate per period
n = 2      # number of periods
d = 1/(1+u) - 1     # down return per period
p = (r-d) / (u-d)   # risk-neutral prob
x = [S*(1+u)**(n-2*i) for i in range(n+1)]
c = np.maximum(0, np.array(x)-K)
while len(c)>1:
    c = (p*c[:-1]+(1-p)*c[1:]) / (1+r)
c[0]
