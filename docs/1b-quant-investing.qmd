##  Security analysts

- Sell-side analysts work for brokerage firms and provide research to brokerage clients.  
  - They are a cost center and research is provided free to generate business (= commissions or advising fees).
- Buy-side analysts work for investment funds who use the research to pick stocks.

## Technical versus fundamental

- Fundamental analysts forecast important ratios and growth rates to produce earnings forecasts and price targets as in Gordon/Dupont.
- Technical analysts use past prices to generate recommendations.

## Technical analysis examples

  - Support and resistance levels. 
    - Previous minimum (support) and maximum (resistance) stock prices are regarded as difficult to breach.  
    - But if breached, the trend is expected to continue.
  - Moving averages: buy when price rises above moving average and sell when it falls below.
  - Chart patterns (head and shoulders, ...)

##

- Quantitative investing means using quantifiable signals to pick stocks and/or to time the market.
- Signals can include ratios and growth rates used by fundamental analysts and price signals used by technical analysts.
- Signals can also include 
  - insider trades, short interest, ...
  - sentiment analysis of social media, traditional media, and company announcements
  - satellite and drone image data, and ...


# Efficient Markets Hypothesis {background-color="#657b83" color="#fdf6e3"}

##

- All relevant information is already impounded into prices.
  - Fundamental analysis is futile.
  - Technical analysis is futile.
- Higher expected returns come only with higher risks: arket risk (beta) and/or other types of risks (oil price, ...)

## Counter-argument

- Not all investors are smart
- Smart investors may not scoop up all opportunities
  - Limited capital 
  - Costs of trading
  - For example, an investor who shorts risks running out of capital from margin calls before being eventually right.
- More likely to be opportunities among smaller stocks, which are difficult for large investors to trade.
