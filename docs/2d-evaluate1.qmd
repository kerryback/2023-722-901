## Overview

- Suppose we've run a backtest and saved the portfolio returns.
- Evaluate raw returns: accumulation, drawdowns, mean, std dev, Sharpe ratio
- Evaluate relative to benchmarks
    - Compare to the market on a beta-adjusted basis
    - Compare to the market and other factors (attribution analysis)


## Drawdowns

- A drawdown occurs whenever your portfolio value is not as high as it once was
- The percent drawdown is (current value - prior max) / prior max.

## Statistics

- mean and std dev of monthly returns
- annualize mean by $\times$ 12
- annualize std dev by $\times$ sqrt(12)
- compute monthly excess returns (in excess of T-bill rate), mean and std dev and Sharpe ratio = mean / std dev
- annualize Sharpe ratio by $\times$ sqrt(12)

## Example accumulation plot

. . .

```.p
(1+ret).cumprod().plot()
(1+mkt).cumprod().plot()
```

. . .

## Example drawdown plot

```.p
accum = (1+ret).cumprod()
accum_max = accum.expanding().max()
drawdown = accum/accum_max - 1
```
